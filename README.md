Dehydrator desiccant tray

Description
I had been using the Filament dryer mod for food dehydrator for quite a while now, but recently started to augment my Eva-dry renewable dehumidifier with these In Spool Desiccant Containers.

This introduced the need to renew the desiccant and I quickly stumbled across @miker33 Dessicant Drying Tray. I liked the use of the Slicer settings to create the "screen" effect on the bottom. Unfortunately, this was not the right dimensions for my larger dehumidifier so this remix was born.

I have included the OpenSCAD file and enabled Customizer so that you can adjust to any other set of dimensions. By default the following parameters were used.

```shell
ECHO: "======> Tray Diameter: 308"
ECHO: "======> Tray Wall Height: 23"
ECHO: "======> Hole Diameter: 68"
ECHO: "======> Wall Width: 2.5"
ECHO: "======> Floor Depth: 3"
```

All of the code/files are contained within GitHub - desiccant_tray
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jshessen/desiccant_tray.git
```
